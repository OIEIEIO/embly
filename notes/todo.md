We're close to something of an MVP. Once there, it should be possible to start
working on embly (the hosting platform) using embly:

1. Use new embly.hcl with existing project structure
2. add embly build
3. add embly push, but just have it package up all necessary files (for now)
4. "migrate" db, check schema
5. Add vinyl to the rust wrapper
6. Figure out what the bare bones server setup looks like
